# Data-Driven-Comparison-of-Formula-1-Drivers-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
The 2023-2024 Spring semester graduation project aims to analyze telemetry and radio data from the Formula 1 2022 and 2023 seasons. The project involves computing driver performance similarity using cosine similarity and exploring hierarchical clustering techniques for driver comparison. Additionally, tanglegrams are employed to visually track changes in driver performance across seasons. Further tests include investigating factors that prompt drivers to communicate with race engineers—such as track conditions versus car telemetry. 

The visualizations of the 2023 Austrian & Mexico City Grand Prix tracks illustrate key points along with the car’s telemetry information, highlighting areas on the track where team radio conversations occur.
